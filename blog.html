        <h3>
            1. localStorage vs sessionStorage
        </h3>
        <p>
            The main and only difference between
            localStorage and sessionStorage the time of
            expire.

            In localStorage data is not cleared
            until we delete it
            but in sessionStorage data is cleared
            automatically after finishing the session.
            <br>
            If we want to share data among
            multiple windows we should use localStorage. However, if we don't want
            to do so than we can use sessionStorage.

        <h3>
            2. Global scope vs block scope
        </h3>
        <p>
            In global scope we can access the variable from everywhere. However, if we declare variable inside {} block
            we can get access only inside the block.
            Variable declared by var will not follow the block scope but let and const will follow. Block scope also
            called a sub-type of local scope. It is asserted that to use global variable is not good practice when they
            are not needed as all block variable can get access.

        <h3>
            3. What is the event loop in javaScript?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The event loop is described to hold a runtime model for
            JavaScript's asynchronous programming which is not similar for C and Java. In other words we can say an
            event loop pulls stuff out of the queue and
            keeps onto the function call stack one after
            another whenever the call stack is
            empty.

        <!-- question 4 -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>
            4. Describe how many ways we get undefined?
        </h3>
        <p>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. <br>
            JavaScript uses the undefined value in the following situations:</p>

        <p>
            1) The variable will have a value of
            undefined if it was uninitialized.
        </p>

        <p>
            2) If you access a non-existing property of an object, you’ll get undefined.
        </p>

        <p>
            3)
            When we don’t pass all the arguments at the time of calling the function, the parameters
            inside the function becomes undefined.




        </p>

        <p>
            4) If we do not return a value it implicitly returns undefined.
        </p>
