        <!-- question 1 -->
        <h3>
            1. Local vs session storage
        </h3>
        <p>
            The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that sessionStorage is unique per tab. If you
            close the tab the sessionStorage gets deleted, localStorage does not. Also you cannot communicate between
            tabs
            :)

            Another subtle difference is that for example on Safari (8.0.3) localStorage has a limit of 2551 k
            characters
            but sessionStorage has unlimited storage

            On Chrome (v43) both localStorage and sessionStorage are limited to 5101 k characters (no difference between
            normal / incognito mode)

            On Firefox both localStorage and sessionStorage are limited to 5120 k characters (no difference between
            normal /
            private mode )
        </p>
